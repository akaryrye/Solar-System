# Solar-System
A group project whe whipped up in just a few days focused on providing educational and interactive content about our solar system.  It utilizes the Wikipedia API and features a CSS animated model of the Sun and orbiting planets.  This project was built with HTML, Jquery, and copious ammounts of CSS.

Thank you and I hope you enjoyed this app!]
